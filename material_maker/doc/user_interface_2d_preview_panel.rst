2D Preview panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 2D preview panel shows a tiled preview of the first output of the selected
node. The corner lines show the bounds of the texture, so it is
easy to check that the texture wraps correctly.

The mouse wheel can be used to zoom, and holding the middle mouse button makes it possible
to pan across the preview.

Depending on the selected node, controls can be shown and they can be moved
around to modify the associated parameters.

The 2D preview panel has a context menu that can be used to:

* reset the preview zoom and position

* select the style and color of axes displayed on top of the preview

* export the previewed texture to a file

* render the previewed texture and add it to the References panel
